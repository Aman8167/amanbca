            <h1>Mr.Anand</h1>
            My Colombian coworker has a question regarding English usage that I can't answer to her (or my satisfaction).

Compare the two phrases:

"the client name"

and

"the client's name"

Both seem to mean the same thing. But compare:

"Scott's cup"

"Scott cup"

The latter would never be used. So what is the reason for the difference in usage? My best guess it that making a (non-possessive) adjective out of the noun implies a more impersonal relationship between the speaker and the possessor. Does anyone have any other feelings towards this phenomenon? That is, when should one form be used? And why do certains nouns become non-possessive adjectives in some situations, and possessive adjectives in others?

Thanks.
<h2>Mr.Abhishek</h2>
or one, ownership or use of a cup is transitory—and one can hold or own more than one—but a client has only one name.

Practicality can be an issue. The phrase "Scott's cup" is unlikely to appear multiple times in a text or to be used in complex sentences, so why shorten it? The phrase "client's name" might appear multiple times in a text and in complex sentences, making it more likely that one would want to simplify it to "client name."

Custom plays a part as well, of course.

Context is important. Can you think of sample sentence that might use the two phrases in a parallel or similar manner?
